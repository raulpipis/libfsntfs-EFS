This is the version of libfsntfs with EFS support.
For all the functions comments exist to describe how they function.
There are two groups of functions:
	libfsntfs_efs_attribute_*, functions that work with the efs attribute
	libfsntfs_efs_data_*, functions that work with the data in the file
I didn't know how to put openssl in automake, so for this version I modified
the automatically generated Makefile and added the library manually.
Also for the attribute functions, the first function to be called must be
libfsntfs_efs_attribute_initialize_data.
The key used in the libfsntfs_efs_data_* functions is the one extracted
using libfsntfs_efs_attribute_* functions.
The RSA key for libfsntfs_efs_attribute_* must ge given in PEM Base64 format
Also in the folder there are two libraries, libtomcrypt and libtommath, that
I tried to integrate with libfsntfs, but I wrongly thought that they do not work
because of the issue with the endianess used by Windows' CryptoAPI. Maybe they
will help with the RSA issue. Libtommath is used to offer support for RSA in
libtomcrypt.
